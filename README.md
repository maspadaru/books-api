# Book Inventory ‚Äì Hexagonal Architecture with Spring Boot

This is a Book Inventory management system built with **Spring Boot**, structured using **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**. The project models a real-world scenario with books and authors, where:

- üìö A book can have **multiple authors**
- ‚úçÔ∏è An author can write **multiple books**

## Features

- ‚úÖ Create, update, and delete books
- ‚úÖ Create and list authors
- üîó Assign and retrieve relationships between books and authors
- üß± Built using Hexagonal Architecture
- üóÑÔ∏è Uses **Spring Data JPA** with a **many-to-many relationship**
- üß™ Uses in-memory **H2 database** for quick development and testing

## Technologies

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database
- Gradle

## Running the App

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
````

Or run `InventoryApplication` directly in your IDE.

## Notes

* The **hexagonal architecture** ensures a clean separation between domain logic and technical concerns like HTTP and database access.
* JPA handles the many-to-many relationship via a join table.
* You can switch to PostgreSQL or another database by changing a few lines in `application.properties`.
